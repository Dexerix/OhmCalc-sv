# OhmCalc-sv

## Descrition
OhmCalc-sv is the official sveltejs port of [OhmCalc-cli](https://github.com/Dexerix/OhmCalc-cli). This web app performs various electrical calculations based on Ohm's law and other electrical formulas.

## Features
- Voltage calculation
- Resistance calculation (Ohm's law)
- Current calculation
- Resistivity calculation
- Cable section calculation
- Resistance calculation using resistivity
- Total resistance calculation for parallel resistors
- Total resistance calculation for serial resistors

## Usage
### Web app
1. Go on [the website](https://ohmcalc.retrosound.club)
2. Choose your calculation from the menu by clicking on the corresponding formula :
   - Voltage
   - Amperage
   - Resistance
   - Section
   - Resitivity
   - Rhosistance (Resistance using rho)
   - Parallel resistors
   - Serial resistors

## Input Format
- For large numbers, you can use scientific notation: `2.5*10^-3` instead of `0.0025`
- Units are automatically handled by the program
- All decimal numbers should use a point (.) as separator
